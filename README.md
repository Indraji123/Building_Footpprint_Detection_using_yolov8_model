# Building_Footpprint_Detection_using_yolov8_model
This project utilizes YOLOv8 for building footprint detection from satellite imagery, specifically targeting the Indian region. The dataset, sourced from Google Satellite, was preprocessed and converted into the YOLOv8 format using Roboflow to ensure proper annotation structure.
