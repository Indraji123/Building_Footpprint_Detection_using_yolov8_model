YOLOv8 Segmentation on Google Satellite Dataset (Indian Region)
Objective: Detect and segment building footprints from satellite imagery, specifically in the Indian region.
Dataset: Sourced from Google Satellite and preprocessed using Roboflow for YOLOv8 compatibility.
Model: Utilized the YOLOv8 segmentation model (yolov8s-seg.pt).
Training:
Conducted for 10 epochs.
Used an image resolution of 512x512.
Predictions:
Generated from the best-performing weights.
Saved for further analysis and visualization.
Applications:
Urban planning.
Disaster management.
Geospatial data analysis.
This project highlights the capability of YOLOv8 in providing accurate building footprint detection for real-world geospatial tasks.
